# Contributing to Quoter

Thanks for your interest in helping to improve Quoter!

### Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to follow this project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nchristopher/quoter/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Failure to do so will result in contributions being rejected.

## Bugs

If you find a bug (eg. grammar mistake, unintended behavior) you can [create an issue](https://github.com/nchristopher/quoter/issues/new/choose). You could also create a pull request to fix the issue yourself. Note that this does **not** include security vulnerabilities - those should be reported as detailed in our [security policy](https://github.com/nchristopher/quoter/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

Fixing these issues ensures Quoter is as polished as it can be!

## Feature Suggestions

If you have an idea for a new feature, [create an issue](https://github.com/nchristopher/quoter/issues/new/choose) with the proper labels. Don't begin working on anything until your issue has been reviewed - we don't want you to do any unnecessary work!

We're always looking for new ways to improve Quoter, but not _everything_ needs to be added.
