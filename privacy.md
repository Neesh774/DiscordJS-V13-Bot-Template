# Quoter Privacy Policy

##### Last updated on 2/14/2021.

This document explains what data is collected, how it's used, and how you can delete your data. **If you have any questions/concerns about this Privacy Policy, join our [support server](https://discord.gg/QzXTgS2CNk) OR email `nchristopher@tuta.io`**.

## What data do we collect, and why do we need it?

We store the following information when users interact with Quoter:

-   The quote's text & the quote's author. Users can later view this information when interacting with Quoter.
-   The current date. Users can later view this information when interacting with Quoter.
-   The creation date of the quoted message, when using the `.quotethat` command. This isn't currently used.
-   The quote creator's Discord ID. This isn't currently used.
-   A prefix set by a server admin. This is used by Quoter to properly respond to & ignore messages.

Data storage is necessary for the bot to do it's basic function - displaying quotes. We never use/collect data for marketing and/or analytics. Data is **only** accessible by Quoter developers, and the user who uses Quoter.

## How can I delete my data?

If Quoter is online when the bot is removed from a Discord server (either by the bot being removed by a server admin, the server being deleted, or Quoter forcibly leaving the server), then Quoter will automatically delete the information tied to a server.

However, **Quoter isn't always online**, so contact us (using the methods at the beginning of this document) to make sure your data has been removed. We don't want to store data longer than necessary!
